This is a codebook for the different data files in this repository.

1. Physiological recordings (files in FMOV folder)
These files contain recordings made using the Acqknowledge software and exported to text files. They have different numbers of columns depending on when in the experiment they were 
Files that have 8 columns have the following data in each column:
  Skin conductance, umho
  Raw EMG of the major zygomatic muscle, mV
  Raw EMG of the superciliary corrugator muscle, mV
  Average rectified EMG of the major zygomatic muscle, mV
  Average rectified EMG of the superciliary corrugator muscle, mV
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, angry
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, happy
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, neutral
Files that have 10 columns have the following data in each column:
  Time (minutes)
  Skin conductance, umho
  Raw EMG of the major zygomatic muscle, mV
  EKG, mV
  Raw EMG of the superciliary corrugator muscle, mV
  Average rectified EMG of the major zygomatic muscle, mV
  Average rectified EMG of the superciliary corrugator muscle, mV
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, angry
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, happy
  Reference wave for image stimulus onset, neutral
